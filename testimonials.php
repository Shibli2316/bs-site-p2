                    "I am deeply grateful to have been a part of the Bahujan Scholar Mentorship Programme , which has
                    been a transformative journey in my academic and personal growth. When I joined the programme, I was
                    in the early stages of shaping my PhD research and facing challenges in finding the right academic
                    guidance. However, the mentorship and research methodology sessions offered by the programme
                    provided me with clarity, direction, and confidence.

                <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 italic">
                    I was fortunate to be mentored by Nefeli Forni Zervoudaki , a Ph.D. candidate at the University of
                    Massachusetts Amherst. Under Nefeli’s guidance, I significantly improved core components of my PhD
                    applications particularly my Statement of Purpose, Motivational Letters, and Research Proposal.

                    <b>As a result of this mentorship, I received selection calls from multiple prestigious
                        universities,
                        including the University of Westminster (UK) , University of Exeter (UK) , and the University of
                        Göttingen (Germany) . I have chosen to pursue funded graduate studies at the University of
                        Göttingen.</b>

                What made the Bahujan Scholar experience even more enriching was the consistent engagement and care
                from the programme’s coordinators. The support and motivation I received especially from Nefeli will
                always remain one of the most pleasant and formative experiences of my life.

                    Tyler Lehrer has been a true privilege. The close, thoughtful attention he devoted to my work

                    the intellectual frameworks I operate within. As a result, I’ve found myself returning to my own
                    work with fresh eyes and a more nuanced critical lens.
