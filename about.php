        To inspire and educate youth from disadvantaged communities in India, mentoring is an indispensable process that
        connects young persons with experienced mentors. The rapid rise of internet-based technology has made it
        possible
        to connect mentees from India with mentors anywhere in the world.

      Instructional technology is a key component of the Bahujan Scholars platform. The platform will connect mentees
      with mentors, motivating youth to pursue higher education in India and abroad. Bahujan Scholars provide learning
      resources, group and one-on-one mentoring, and a social platform for organizing educational and professional
      events. We are developing an online directory of group members to facilitate collaboration and support. The
      directory will be accessible only to members.

          First, mentors and mentees enroll on the Bahujan Scholars platform, which then selects a suitable mentor for
          each mentee. After matching, an online orientation provides an overview of the program. Mentor-mentee
          communication proceeds based on availability, with the mentor offering guidance to support the mentee. Bahujan
          Scholars collects monthly feedback from mentees to evaluate the process and ensure both parties' needs are
          met.

          In 2023, we collaborated with a non-profit organization in India and designed a One-on-One pilot project
          called "Bahujan Mentoring." The project matched ten mentors from Bahujan Scholars with ten mentees from India
          based on their academic and professional backgrounds. This was an international project in which mentors were
          graduate students and faculty members located outside India, all in North America, and mentees were in India.
          The project started in March 2024 and completed in August 2024.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-900 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Mentoring is a “process concerned with the informal diffusion of knowledge, social capital, and psychological
        support perceived by the recipient as relevant to his or her work, career, or professional development” (Bozeman
        & Feeney, 2007, p. 731). In other words, mentoring is a learning process between young persons (mentees) and
        experienced persons (mentors) who share their knowledge and experience with the mentees to achieve their
        academic, professional and career goals.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-900 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Mentoring is a transformative experience that fosters social networks and positively impacts both mentors and
        mentees.
        For mentees, it provides an opportunity to excel in their academic, professional, social, and career pursuits.
        Mentors,
        in turn, can develop leadership and social skills, build professional connections, and derive satisfaction from
        their
        meaningful contribution to society.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-900 mb-6">Studies show that young adults with a mentor are:</p>
      <ul class="list-none pl-5 mb-6">

      </ul>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-900 mb-6">Young adults facing an opportunity gap who have a mentor are 55% more likely
        to be enrolled in college than those who did not have a mentor. (Source: The Mentoring Effect, 2014)</p>
