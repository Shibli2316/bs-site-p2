        Historically, disadvantaged communities in India have faced significant barriers to accessing education.
        This exclusion continues to be a pressing issue, particularly in higher education. disadvantaged communities
        are underrepresented in elite institutions, and systemic barriers hinder their ability to earn degrees.
        Despite decades of this status quo, systemic change seems elusive. Research demonstrates the positive impact
        of mentoring on mentees' outcomes and their engagement in their communities. Mentoring is especially crucial
        for youth from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing hope, role models, guidance, and support that formal
        education often lacks. The Bahujan Scholarss group, started on WhatsApp, aims to connect Bahujan Scholarss
        from outside India. This rapidly growing group, with 86 members, includes graduate students, faculty, and
        Scholarss. Its purpose is to foster mentoring, support Bahujan Scholarss, and organize online events.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Mentoring is a transformative experience that fosters social networks and positively impacts both mentors and mentees.
        For mentees, it provides an opportunity to excel in their academic, professional, social, and career pursuits. Mentors,
        in turn, can develop leadership and social skills, build professional connections, and derive satisfaction from their
        meaningful contribution to society.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">Studies show that young adults with a mentor are:</p>
      <ul class="list-none pl-5 mb-6">
        <li class="text-lg mb-3 text-gray-800"><span>&#8680;</span> 130% more likely to hold leadership positions.</li>
        <li class="text-lg mb-3 text-gray-800"><span>&#8680;</span> 90% are interested in becoming a mentor.</li>
        <li class="text-lg mb-3 text-gray-800"><span>&#8680;</span> 78% more likely to volunteer regularly. (Source: Mentoring.org)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">Young adults facing an opportunity gap who have a mentor are 55% more likely to be enrolled in college than those who did not have a mentor. (Source: The Mentoring Effect, 2014)</p>
