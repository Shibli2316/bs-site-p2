            <p class="text-gray-500">In October 2024, we launched a one-on-one mentoring program, “NextGen Global Scholar.” Program is a collaboration between Bahujan Scholars and NextGen Global Scholar. The program aims to assist mentees in achieving their graduate study aspirations in India and abroad. The Program enrolled 10 selected mentees from NextGen Global Scholar, a community-led organization in north India working with young scholars from Bahujan communities, based on English and academic skills. We matched selected mentees with 10 appropriate mentors from any background who have international education experience. The program is designed to mentor mentees for a six-month period, and if required, we will continue selected mentor-mentee pairs for another six months. We will collect monthly feedback from mentees and final feedback from mentors. We provide our network support to mentee for their academic and professional development needs. We are developing online resources (e.g., Academic Repository of templates, Online directory of Bahujan Scholars members, and YouTube channel) for our members, including mentees, to learn, connect, and collaborate with others. 
<br>
Once matched, mentors and mentees are responsible for finding a suitable time and platform to communicate regularly. We require around 30-minute weekly time commitment, but there is no obligation to continue once you begin. Since this is a volunteer-run program, flexibility and understanding are essential for the mentoring process.
