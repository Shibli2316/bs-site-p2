It is a rapidly growing WhatsApp-based network of scholars from Bahujan communities. Bahujan Scholars hosts 95 scholars (graduate students, faculty, and scholars) from outside India. The purpose of this program is to support Bahujan Scholars, promote collaboration, assist in anti-caste activism on campus, and organize online events. We organize monthly online events on academic and professional development topics, and recordings of the events are posted on Bahujan Scholars channel.  </p>
